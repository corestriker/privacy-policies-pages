  <h2>2. App Distribution</h2>
  <p>
    GymBuddy is distributed via the Google Play Store. When downloading and
    using the app, the privacy policies of Google also apply.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Processing of Personal Data</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Local Data Storage</h3>
  <p>
    All workout-related data entered by you (such as workouts, exercises,
    repetitions, weights, and time tracking) is stored exclusively on your
    device. No data is transmitted to external servers.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 No Analytics or Tracking</h3>
  <p>
    GymBuddy does not use analytics, tracking, or advertising services. No user
    profiles are created and no personal data is analyzed.
  </p>

  <h2>4. External Content (GIFs)</h2>

  <p>
    To visualize exercises, the app loads animated GIFs from the following
    external provider:
  </p>
  <p>
    https://static.exercisedb.dev/
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Method of Integration</h3>
  <p>
    The GIFs are loaded directly via their URLs and displayed within the app
    (for example via Flutter Image or CachedNetworkImage).
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Automatic Data Transmission</h3>
  <p>
    When opening certain screens of the app, a connection to the servers of
    the external provider is automatically established. Due to technical
    reasons, information such as the IP address may be transmitted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app developer has no influence over the nature, scope, or purpose of
    data processing carried out by this third-party provider.
  </p>

  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children and Minors</h2>
